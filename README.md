# Procedural Turtle

![Procedural Turtle](https://github.com/ahuliangbo/procedural-turtle/blob/main/proceduralturtledemo.gif)

**Procedural Turtle** is a simple Unity demo project that features a procedurally modelled turtle. The turtle's head, legs, tail, and shell are all procedurally animated. It features a walking script that will make it walk to a specified target when in range.
## Features

- **Procedural Legs**: The turtle's legs move smoothly in a natural sequence. The legs will rotate in response to the terrain surface and will never snap or jerk to certain positions/heights.

- **Rotating Body**: The turtle's body rotates in response to the shape of the terrain, based of the individual heights of its four legs.

- **Flicking Tail**: The turtle's tail flicks naturally from side to side. The tail has physics and will land on the terrain.
- **Head Aiming**: When the target moves in range of the turtle, the turtle's head will aim toward the target and the turtle will start moving towards it.

- **Idle Animation**: When there is no target in range, the turtle will scan for targets with it's head.
